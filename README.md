# D3-barChart
D3 tutorial via Mike Bostok https://bost.ocks.org/mike/bar/

- Part I is a basic chart in HTML with local data stored as a JavaScript object.

- Part II is the same chart built with svg, loading data asynchronously from a .tsv file.  
  *Note: Part II will not load on the Chrome browser, because Chrome does not allow local file requests*
