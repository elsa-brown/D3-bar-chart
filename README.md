# D3 Bar Chart
A tutorial I completed to begin learning D3.  
*via Mike Bostok: https://bost.ocks.org/mike/bar *

- Part I is a basic chart in HTML with local data stored as a JavaScript object.

- Part II is the same chart built with svg, loading data asynchronously from a .tsv file.  
  *Part II will not load on a Chrome browser, because Chrome does not allow local file requests*
